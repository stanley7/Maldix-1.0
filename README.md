People often ask, can a machine feel what we feel? can it grasp emotions?
Maybe not yet but that's what we are trying to explore. 

Maldix is a literary converstional AI that speaks as the wind. 
That means it's a character and it doesn't sound like a normal chatbot. 

Maldix blends sixteen fine-tuned expert language models with a symbolic layer.
With the help of an abstract language called ABEL, Maldix reason about what people feel and mean.

ABEL doesn’t replace the neural model, it guides it.
Before Maldix decides which voice should speak, ABEL tells it what the user is feeling and talking about.
That’s how we move from keyword routing to meaning-based routing.
